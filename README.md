 Quantum machine learning is a branch of machine learning that combines classical and quantum computing. It has the potential to
 revolutionize computer science, and could help us solve some of the most important problems we face as a society. With a
 strong motive to create a better and healther world, I decided that for my graduation project will be about quantum computing and AI, combined!
